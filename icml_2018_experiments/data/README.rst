This folder contains results from experiments that were not conducted using code from this repo.
They consist mostly of runs of Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization for the surrogates benchmarks.
We provide them for completeness to be able to reproduce the plots, but rerunning them would take a considerable amount of time as the Gaussian Processes are relatively expensive.
